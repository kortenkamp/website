### Generation of Limit Sets of Kleinian Groups Using a Feedback Loop Approach

Press `SPACE` to reset everything. The red and the blue point determine the complex parameters ta, tb, which will be pluged into Grandma's recipe from Indra's Pearls: The Vision of Felix Klein, David Mumford, ‎Caroline Series, ‎David Wright.

The internal computations are done in an exp-log-conjugated world (conformal polar coordinates). Hence we have more details in the middle, less outside, and we can almost march to infinity.
