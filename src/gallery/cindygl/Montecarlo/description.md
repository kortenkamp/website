The visualization is generated by simulating several photons that show a random refraction behavior at surfaces. With this, a realistic lighting model is obtained. If you keep the applet running for some time, then more simulated photons are taken into consideration, and the average lightness is displayed.

##### Software:
  The simulation runs in [CindyGL](https://cindyjs.org/docs/cindygltutorial/)
